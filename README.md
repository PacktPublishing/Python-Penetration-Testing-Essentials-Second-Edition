# Python Penetration Testing Essentials - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Python Penetration Testing Essentials - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/python-penetration-testing-essentials-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789138962), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book gives you the skills you need to use Python for penetration testing (pentesting), with the help of detailed code examples.

We start by exploring the basics of networking with Python and then proceed to network hacking. Then, you will delve into exploring Python libraries to perform various types of pentesting and ethical hacking techniques. Next, we delve into hacking the application layer, where we start by gathering information from a website. We then move on to concepts related to website hackingâ€”such as parameter tampering, DDoS, XSS, and SQL injection.

By reading this book, you will learn different techniques and methodologies that will familiarize you with Python pentesting techniques, how to protect yourself, and how to create automated programs to find the admin console, SQL injection, and XSS attacks.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import os
response = os.popen('ping -n 1 10.0.0.1')
for line in response.readlines():
    print line,
```

In order to understand the book reader must have the knowledge of Networking fundamentals, basic knowledge of Linux OS, good knowledge of information security and core Python.

In order to perform experiments or run the codes reader can use the virtual machine (Vmware, virtual box). For Wireless pen-testing readers can use a wireless card TP-Link TL-WN722N. Becuase TL-WN722N wireless card supports the Kali Linux in VMware.
